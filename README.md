# 5512_PokerAI
A repo for our group's final project for CSCI 5512--a report and accompanying code on a poker playing AI


Thesis:

Testing the player against a variety of opponents with different intialized strategies and seeing how the player does compared to each of the different opponents. Analyze the results.

How does the initialization of the players strategy matrices effect the Nash equilibrium against our agent -- what differences do the beginning initializations make in terms of how long it takes to reach and equilibrium as well as what that equilibrium looks like. Hypothesis: that eventually they would be the same since hand strengths prob is constant. Maybe see how each player does in terms of winnings as well--the cost of learning / the value of learning this equilibrium. Change only player 1's initializations.

Different initializations for player 1 means different initializing of the counts--use this to outline the initial probabilities.

To Do:

Everyone use the code (ideally both sets of codes) to test out a different initialization and make a plot / chart of the results along with a table.

Mike's code player 1 always goes 1st player 2 always goes 2nd

just run mikes code it will all print out on its own
