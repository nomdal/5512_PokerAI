Put in here links and descriptions of different studies related to the project. Will then use during the writing of the report.

1: "Improved Opponent Modeling in Poker"

http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~duane/publications/pdf/2000icai.pdf

Explains why poker is an interesting model to use for AI research. 
Focuses on importance of deriving different opponents styles.
Poker involves modeling:
  The opponent's cards
  Many players 
  Deception / bluffs
  Agent modeling
The study outlines basics of opponent modeling:
  During the course of each hand, a weight table
  is maintained for each opponent. For each
  possible combination of hole cards, the table
  gives the probability that the opponent would
  have played that hand to the present point in
  the game. Since there are only 1326 two-card
  combinations, it is convenient to store a value
  in the range 0.0 to 1.0 for each particular hand.
  This probability distribution is updated after
  each opponent action, to be consistent with
  the betting decisions observed throughout the
  current hand. The precise details of this reweighting
  process depends on our method of
  modeling each opponent.
We can cite this as how we modeled our hand strength and bet probabilities

2. "A Case-Based Learner for Poker"

"The poker card game may on the surface seem
to be a game almost of the classic type, but has important
characteristics that also makes it a psychological
game, involving both interpreting other players
behavior and modifying own behavior as the game
goes on."

"Hand strength (Hnd). This is a relative numeric
value calculated with the Meerkat Library. This
is relative to the number of opponents in the
hand. The values range from 0-100 where 100
indicates an unbeatable hand."

They conducted an experiment playing against opponent and having their agent implemented with 
a variety of basic strategies that include:
CheckFold
Bluff
CallAny
SemiBluff
RaiseAny
CheckRaise
And then they compared the win / loss results of their agent using each of these strategies

3. "A Simplified Two-Person Poker"

https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=OVfQCwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA97&dq=poker+strategy&ots=2Kf5eZ7b9Z&sig=YHlXf9DLeiUEvQ4Yyp2m6o1dIt8#v=onepage&q=poker%20strategy&f=false

Take a look at a viable way to simplify the game for research, where there are only two players going back
and forth for a limited number of moves

Three turns, so one player starts, the other goes, then the first player ends.

Looks at the game theory of this, breaking the game down into a payoff matrix

This matrix is sensative to the effects of bluffing, and the paper discusses this
and derives good strategies accordingly.
